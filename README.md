# Gas_Turbine_Internship

This is My Internship Work of "Using Anomaly Detections on Gas Turbine using Z-Score" 
Steps of work execution:- 
<br>
<ol>
  <li>First takes data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muniryadi/gasturbine-co-and-nox-emission-data">Kaggle</a></li>
  <li>Then Prerform Data Preprocessing.</li>
  <li>Finding Outlier using Z-Score in both NOx and CO columns separately.</li>
  <li>Then create a 2 new columns which classified that if it is outlier then value is 1 otherwise it will be 0.</li>
  <li>Then create a Ensemble Model to predicts it is Outlier or not</li>
</ol>
